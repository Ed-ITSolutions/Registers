# Registers

Registers is an [atom-shell] application for taking pupil attendance registers in Primary Schools (or any institution with 2 sessions and fixed classes).

Please use the Pre-built Binaries from the Releases page for actually using Registers in a live environment.

## Running in Development

Run `apm install` to get all the node modules required (note `apm` not `npm`)
